                An *Application Programming Interface* (API) is a set of subroutine definitions,
                protocols, and tools for building software and applications.

                They are *everywhere*!

                * OS (POSIX, Windows API, Cocoa, iOS, Android, ...)
                * Software libraries (C++, Scala, Java, Python, Javascript, ...)
                * Protocols, Remote APIs (JDBC, ...)
                * Web API (SOAP, REST, ...)

                ## API

                 API is not an implementation, only defines the *interface*

                 * Protocol
                 * Functions
                 * Data models of input/output objects

                ## Why Web API?

                * Allow to easily build new applications
                * Simplify development (API is fixed, known contract)
                * Allow new services to be built, used (either internally or externally)
                * Same approach than traditional software development
